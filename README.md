## Welcome to MessAI Engineering Github

[**MessAI**](https://messai.in) was founded to revlotionize the way people Profile their Customers by leveraing cutting edge deep learning algorithms coupled with intelligent Alternate Data Harvesting methods.

MessAI Engineering aims at creating tools and software which enable enterprises to extract and transform data about their customers and infer behavioural traits about them. We have our humble beginnings in building a patented meta-data driven text-parser named Malana. Later on the ecosystem grew to include an analytics engine based on top of [Metabase](https://metabase.com), a hosted machine learning system named [Arachea](https://github.com/archaea-solutions/archaea), an intelligent date parser based on FSAs called [Yuga](https://github.com/messai-engineering/Yuga) and an android based offline inference system using [TFLite](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow).

User Privacy has always been the cornerstone of what we did and what we continue to do. Traditional Customer Profiling systems focus on taking customer data to the servers, storing and processing it on the cloud, thus violating their End Users Privacy and raking in significant server costs. Our current ecosystem enables an Enterprise to profile their customers completely in the edge, ensuring that all data stays in the customer device itself and the whole processing is offloaded to the edge.

Thus our **MessAI Suite** allows Enterprises to build a privacy-aware, intelligent, distributed and extensible Custoemer Profiling pipeline.

Our journey has always been dependent on Open Source tech and if not for them, we would've never been able to accomplish what we have done.

[MessAI engineering](https://github.com/messai-engineering) is just a humble attempt to give something back to the community and share the ❤️.

### Repositories
- [Yuga](https://github.com/messai-engineering/Yuga)
	- 
	Yuga is an intelligent Date Parser.Parses text for any date format and returns the date object. No need to know format type. Returns a date object for  a string containing a date in any arbitrary format
- [Arachea](https://github.com/archaea-solutions/archaea)
	- 
	Data analysis through machine learning on cloud. Arachea is a PaaS for Machine Learning. The idea is to have ML as a service and any application developer to bring up API's to use them to train and build their own neural networks and other machine learning tools.
- [Metabase Fork](https://github.com/metabase/metabase)
	- 
	Metabase is at the core of our analytics systems. We have built an extensive set of queries to be run on the meta-data that we have extracted to make analysts life easier.
